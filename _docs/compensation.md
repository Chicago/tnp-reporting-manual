## Scope

A record of each of the licensee's drivers who is paid an hourly rate, and any other record needed to capture actual TNP driver pay information that is not reflected in licensee's hourly rate compensation records.

TNP companies may apply different compensation schemes. Therefore, some columns may be 0 for all records because those elements are not used.

## File Format

Compensation data must be reported using the following schema and reported with the following `[company]-compensation-[date].csv`.

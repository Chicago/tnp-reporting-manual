# TNP Reporting Manual
As part of its licensing process for Transportation Network Providers (sometimes called Rideshare Providers), Chicago requires the companies to report on their activities monthly.  These requirements are set forth in [Chapter 9-115] (https://chicagocode.org/9/9-115/) of the Municipal Code of Chicago and [Rule TNP2.02] (https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/dol/rulesandregs/TNPRulesFinalEFF20151120.pdf) issued by the Department of Business Affairs & Consumer Protection.

This repository contains the technical specifications TNPs should use in preparing their files.  Any changes will be published as updates to these documents.

For questions relating to these reporting requirements, please e-mail tnp-data-reporting@cityofchicago.org.

For TNP matters relating to anything other than data reporting, please e-mail BACPPV@cityofchicago.org.
